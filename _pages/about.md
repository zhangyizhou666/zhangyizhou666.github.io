# üëã Hello, I'm Robin Zhang

I'm a passionate Computer Science undergraduate at **International Christian University (ICU)** in Tokyo, with a focus on mobile AI applications and LLM technologies. Currently, I'm broadening my horizons as an exchange student at **University of California, Davis**.

My research interests center around:
- Developing locally-run Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobile devices
- Creating AI agent applications for student productivity
- Exploring the intersection of mobile computing and artificial intelligence

I'm committed to building technology that enhances everyday experiences while respecting user privacy through on-device AI solutions.
