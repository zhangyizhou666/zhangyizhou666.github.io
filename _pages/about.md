# 👋 Hello, I'm Robin Zhang

I'm a passionate Computer Science undergraduate at **International Christian University (ICU)** in Tokyo, with a focus on applying Agentic AI Architecture to daily applications and LLM Fine Tuning. Currently, I'm broadening my horizons as an exchange student at **University of California, Davis**.

My research interests center around:
- Developing locally-run Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobile devices
- Creating AI agent applications for network administration and system automation
- Fine-tuning models for natural language to system command translation

I'm committed to building technology that enhances everyday experiences while respecting user privacy through on-device AI solutions.
