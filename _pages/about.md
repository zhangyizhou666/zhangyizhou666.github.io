# üëã Hello, I'm Yizhou(Robin)

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at **International Christian University (ICU)** in Tokyo, with a focus on applying Agentic AI Architecture to Small Language Models by applying LLM Fine Tuning. Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at **Sony Computer Science Laboratory**.

My research interests center around:
- Developing locally-run LLM applications for edge devices
- Creating AI agent applications with small language models
- Fine-tuning small base models for better performance on specific tasks

I'm committed to building on-device AI solutions that runs at a low cost and respects user privacy.

> For a deeper understanding of Small Language Models (SLMs) and their role in agentic AI, see the NVIDIA research paper:  
> **‚ÄúSmall Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI‚Äù**  
> [Read the paper](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/)  
>  
> _‚ÄúSLMs are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI.‚Äù_
