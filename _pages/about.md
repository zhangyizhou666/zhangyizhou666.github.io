# 👋 Hello, I'm Yizhou (Robin)

I'm a trilingual **Information Science** undergraduate at **International Christian University (ICU)** in Tokyo (exchange year at **UC Davis**), focusing on **LLM agents**, **data analytics**, and **shipping real products**.  
Right now I'm a **Business Analyst Intern at ByteDance / TikTok Japan** and a former **Research Assistant at Sony Computer Science Laboratories (Sony CSL)**.

I enjoy building practical tools that help real users – from timetable automation for 600+ students to internal analytics dashboards and LLM-powered assistants.
